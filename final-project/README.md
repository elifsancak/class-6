# Final Project

> [Final Project Starter Repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/class-6-starter)

In the upcoming 6 weeks you'll be immersed into the web developer life. By the end of it you will have created and deployed a full-stack web application.

Everything you have learned so far will be combined and put into practice. Added to that you'll learn about collaboration and deployment, skills that will complete the package.

Along with practicing your programming skills you will also be working on your communication skills. This is just as important, because you need to be able to communicate your ideas and efforts in an easy-to-understand manner.

## What we expect from you

This module is about much more than just the code. It's also about planning projects, structuring your development process, and working collaboratively.  This module is also the final assessment for you time at HYF.  We'll be watching you!

But what will we be watching for?
* Participation on Sundays
* Active communication on Slack
* Wednesday check-ins
* Small, well-named commits
* Disciplined branching & merging

## What you can expect from the module

So that's what we expect from you, but what can you expect from yourselves?  You can expect to learn so much!

After the first two weeks you will break into 3 teams, each team can decide what project it wants to build.  (We'll work with you to make sure that it's possible ;).   Teams can build the same project working in parallel to find different solutions, or each team can build a different project.

Technical skills:

- How to `build a complete full-stack application`
- Understanding `how each part of an application relates` to each other
- What it means to work on a `feature`
- How to work with `GIT in a team setting`
- How to write `readable code`

Communication skills:

- How to `communicate effectively` with team members
- `Keeping track` of your project's progress
- Knowing if you `understand what's asked` of you
- How to `communicate with non-developers` about what you're doing
- Learning how to be `solutions-oriented`
- How to work in a `Scrum setting`

## The Schedule

The project module will take 6 weeks.  There are 3 different phases to the project:

### Week 1

In the first week you will become familiar with the starter repository and plan your final project.  Planning will include:

* User Stories
* Setting up your team's project board
* Defining your Data Tables

By the end of the week, your team should have a deployed "hello world" version of your final project.  This doesn't need to be anything more than a static web page, but it should be built using the starter repo and deployed using the GitHub Action.

### Week 2

In this second week your team will work on coordinating your development for the remaining 5 weeks.  This includes:

* Filling your project board with a backlog of tasks
* Defining milestones for the coming weeks
* Coming up with a communication plan for the coming weeks

### Weeks 3, 4, 5

Build!

### Week 6

Feature Freeze!  Put the finishing touches on whatever you have working, prepare a pitch, and get ready to present your project at graduation.

## Weekly Check-Ins

Every Wednesday you'll be required to post a little update on your progress through the week's objectives.  Nothing extreme, just a little post so we all know where you're at and how we can help each other out.

Here's a template you can use as a starting point, but feel free to add more information!
